# Installation

To integrate `exhandlers` into your project, install the package using npm:

```sh
npm install exhandlers
```

This will download and add `exhandlers` as a dependency in your project, allowing you to leverage its pre-built middleware and handlers without writing them from scratch.

## Prerequisites

Before installing `exhandlers`, ensure that you have the following dependencies set up:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later recommended)
- **npm** (comes bundled with Node.js)
- **Express.js** (if not installed, add it using `npm install express`)
