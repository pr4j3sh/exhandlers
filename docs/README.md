# exhandlers Documentation

`exhandlers` is a comprehensive collection of middleware and handler functions designed to streamline backend development in Express.js. It provides pre-built utilities for handling databases, WebSocket connections, AMQP connections, logging, and various other essential middleware functionalities.

By integrating `exhandlers`, developers can eliminate the need to write common handlers from scratch, thereby reducing development overhead and ensuring a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
